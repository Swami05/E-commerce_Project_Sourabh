# E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project aims to identify key factors leading to product returns in an e-commerce setting and develop insights to reduce return rates. Using historical sales, product, and customer data, the analysis focuses on understanding the return patterns and building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: Olist (Brazilian E-commerce Dataset)
- Final Dataset: ecommerce_return_dataset.csv
- Features: Order ID, Product Category, Customer State, Payment Type, Price, Freight Value, Review Score, Is Returned

## ðŸš€ Key Steps
1. Data Merging: Combined multiple CSV files into a single dataset
2. Data Cleaning: Removed null values, formatted columns
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed return patterns by category, region, review score
4. Power BI Dashboard:
   - KPI Cards: Total Orders, Total Returns, Return Rate (%)
   - Combo Chart: Return Rate & Counts by Review Score
   - Bar Charts: Returns by Payment Method, Returns by Product Category
   - Map/Bar Chart: Return Rate by Region
   - Slicers: Product Category, Customer State, Payment Type

## ðŸ“Š Insights
- Products with low review scores have higher return rates.
- Certain states show disproportionately high return rates.
- The 'Boleto' payment method has slightly lower returns.

## ðŸ“Ž Deliverables
- Python Notebook (Data Cleaning & EDA)
- Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)
- Project Report (PDF)
